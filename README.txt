Computer Graphics Assignment 1

Objective: To create a drawing interface that allows the user to draw lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons and polylines.
Degree of Success: 70%

Work Description: Was successfully able to implement an equation for drawing lines and circles pixel-by-pixel. Was then able
to create equations for creating rectangles, polygons and polylines by reusing the line equation within different contexts.
Originally developed each feature using an interface that required the user to input point coordinates, but it was replaced
later with a clickable environment. Also added an eraser button to clear the canvas.

Wasn't able to get the equation for drawing ellipse completed by the deadline. The current version can only draw ellipses
that are either perfectly vertical or horizontal. The unfinished code for the ellipse is included, but disabled to prevent
crashing. Also was unable to implement proper rubberbanding.

How to Run:
1) Project should be able to run simply by downloading the project file and running hw1.html as is. Out of the files contained,
only hw1.html, hw1.css, and hw1.js are required for the project to run properly.

I took the getMousePos function used in this tutorial for use in calculating the mouse's position on the canvas.

Other than the source above, this submission is entirely my own work.
